# SwApiExamplesCs
Some random SOLIDWORKS API usage examples from modern C#.

The examples **ARE NOT** the API Fundamentals examples. For that, it is highly recommend that you take an official SOLIDWORKS API Fundamentals course (check w/your VAR to see if they offer it).

These examples **ARE** just some random bits and pieces that have been conjured up while exploring the API object model with the added goal in mind of using modern C# (4 and beyond) code.

## To run the examples...

- Download/install the training files for the API Fundamentals class from SOLIDWORKS. The code examples don't matter and this project will just make use of the CAD files for the examples.
- To avoid unnecessary grief, be sure to install the training files to the default location because some examples simply hard-code paths to certain traning folders and/or files for simplicity when an example needs to open a certain file or save an output, etc.
